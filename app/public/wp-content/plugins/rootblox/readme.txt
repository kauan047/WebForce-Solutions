== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Rootblox? =

Rootblox is a powerful WordPress plugin that integrates with WordPress' Full Site Editing (FSE) feature to provide advanced header and footer options with responsive design in mind. Customizing headers and footers has never been easier, with over 20 header patterns and more than 50 footer patterns available. With user experience as the priority, features like a sticky header are just a toggle away. The plugin also minimizes header clutter with a responsive menu layout—everything designed to help you create a professional, fully customized website with no coding required.

= Will Rootblox work with any WordPress theme? =

Of course! Rootblox is designed to be theme-independent and works seamlessly with Full Site Editing (FSE) compatible themes. You can rest assured that its features won't conflict with FSE themes.

= Do I need a page builder like Elementor or WPBakery to use Rootblox? =

Additional plugins often mean a sluggish website—especially when they integrate with page builders, which can significantly slow things down. To avoid this, Full Site Editing (FSE) is the best choice, and Rootblox complements FSE perfectly by simplifying the creation of headers and footers—a task that has traditionally been a challenge. With Rootblox, it's challenge accepted!

= Is Rootblox compatible with classic (non-FSE) themes? =

Rootblox is built to work specifically with Full Site Editing (FSE), so compatibility with classic themes is not currently a feature. Since the Customizer layout may or may not be fully compatible with FSE or Gutenberg blocks, Rootblox focuses on delivering the best experience within the FSE environment.

= How easy is it to work with the pre-built layouts? =

It's incredibly easy! You can switch between pre-built layouts with just a single click.

= Does Rootblox support sticky headers? =

Absolutely! A smooth sticky header is a given with Rootblox. The header remains fully visible at the top as users scroll, making website navigation much more convenient.

= Can I create mobile-friendly, responsive menus? =

The Advanced Navigation Builder is one of Rootblox's key features. It gives you complete control over creating adaptive, mobile-friendly menus.
